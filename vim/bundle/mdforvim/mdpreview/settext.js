var text = '<p>It\"s 13 minutes to 11pm where am at, on a Thursday evening. And am listening to Avril Lavigne on the little speaker that I managed to rig to my computer. Well, it\"s a laptop without a working battery. So really it\"s a desktop. Am working. Or rather, am sitting here waiting for the software platform that I work on to spit out a task. Mostly though, am just sitting here thinking of a good many things. I also have the bad luck of having a neighbour who thinks he is Ed Sheeran even though a frog\"s croak is much better. Much much better. Anyway, I guess this is how life should be. A series of unfortunate events with a short reprieve in between just to make you think twice when you are about to give up. Like someone torturing you to the brink of death only to heal you up and start all over. Fuck! </p><p>My birthday was yesterday. I just realized that today though. It\"s like that every year though, so no surprise there. Some years I remember after a month has passed and its like \"damn, I guess am a year older now\" I have never celebrated my birthday anyway. I don\"t think anyone in our family ever does, I have certainly never seen it. We don\"t even know each other\"s birthdays for fuck\"s sake!</p>';
